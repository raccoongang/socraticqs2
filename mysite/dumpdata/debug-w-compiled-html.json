      "title": "How to Identify Student Misconceptions via an Active Learning Exercise? Answer",
      "url": null,
      "text": "Concretely, we want to pose a question and get detailed responses from students that reveal their thinking, whatever it may be.  We'll refer to this as Open Response Concept Testing (ORCT), to emphasize that it accepts any text answer (not limited to multiple choice!).\r\nThe challenge of accurately identifying specific misconceptions suggests the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n* **focus**: an ORCT should exercise a *single* concept.  The purpose\r\n  of an ORCT is to *teach* a concept, not to test the ability\r\n  to *combine* multiple concepts (synthesis).\r\n  An ORCT that involves multiple\r\n  concepts will be opaque to students who don't yet correctly\r\n  understand one of the concepts, yielding no useful learning or\r\n  information.  Focusing on a single concept maximizes\r\n  the chance that students will be able to articulate an\r\n  answer that reveals how they think about that concept.\r\n* **real-world application**: the easiest and most useful model for\r\n  writing an ORCT is to take *any real-world problem that\r\n  involves the concept*, and to ask a question that's simple\r\n  enough to fit our other criteria (e.g. *focus* only on that concept).\r\n  Drawing on real world problems\r\n  that you want students to be able to solve after they complete\r\n  the course, both signals students what really matters, and\r\n  creates powerful motivation (because they see that the concepts\r\n  are key for figuring out real problems).\r\n* **hide in plain sight**: the question should be\r\n  easy for anyone who understands the concept,\r\n  but *requires* understanding (guessing won't work).  Aim for \r\n  1/3 to 2/3 of your students to get it \"mostly right\".\r\n\r\n  \"hide\" means the answer requires *thinking* about the concept,\r\n  not just remembering something you told them;\r\n  \"in plain sight\" means the answer lies directly in view of\r\n  such thought (not hidden under a rock!).\r\n\r\n* **speed**: once the student understands what the question is asking,\r\n  it should only take a minute or two to think out their answer,\r\n  and another couple minutes to type and submit their answer.  ORCT are for *teaching*, hence each ORCT should perform its function as quickly as possible, so that students can learn as many concepts *as possible* per unit time.  In other words, the limit on how much they can learn per unit time should not be *how long the ORCT takes to answer* but rather *how long the students' follow-up work takes* (to fix their misconceptions exposed by the ORCT).\r\n* **simplicity**: to achieve the above goals, we generally have\r\n  to dramatically simplify a real-world problem, down to an\r\n  extremely simple core question.\r\n* **conceptual thinking, not mechanics, and not remembering**:\r\n  the solution should depend only on \r\n  thinking about the concept, not on mechanical operations (e.g.\r\n  solving an algebra equation).  The purpose of ORCT is to reveal how each\r\n  student thinks about the concept; nothing extraneous should be\r\n  allowed to get in the way of that.  Note also that we need the\r\n  students to voice *their own thoughts*, in their own words, otherwise\r\n  we can't learn how they actually think.  In particular, we should\r\n  avoid triggering their instinct to echo back our original \r\n  definition of the concept -- all that would show is that they\r\n  *remember what we said*, not that they understand how to use it.\r\n* **identifiability**: the wording of the question should do its\r\n  best to elicit a specific statement of the student's reasoning,\r\n  so that we can diagnose the underlying conceptual error for\r\n  any wrong answer.  One simple way to do this is to ask for a\r\n  definite answer to a specific question (\"Are Propositions 1 and\r\n  2 in fact contradictory?\"), and then ask them to provide their\r\n  logical justification (\"If so, briefly explain why; if not, why not\").\r\n\r\n  Indeed, one could go so far as to say this is the key purpose of\r\n  ORCT: to elicit *interpretable wrong answers*.  That is, for\r\n  every student with a misconception about this concept, get them\r\n  to articulate it clearly.  (\"All right answers resemble one\r\n  another, but each wrong answer is wrong in its own way\").\r\n  Note that this is *difficult*: if one out of five of the students'\r\n  wrong answers is *lucidly* wrong, you are doing well!\r\n* **independence**: each ORCT should have as little connection as\r\n  possible to \"what you told them\" in your lecture intro.  The key\r\n  word of course is \"possible\": it *must* have some connection to\r\n  what you told them, namely the concept itself -- but no more.\r\n  In particular, it must not be\r\n  possible to \"remember the answer\" to an ORCT -- otherwise it\r\n  is merely testing *memory*, not thinking or understanding.\r\n\r\n  This is challenging, because students (especially undergraduates)\r\n  are trained to think success = \"knowing the right answer\",\r\n  via a process of training by repetition: repeat a procedure\r\n  over and over until you \"know how to do it\".  This \"algorithm\r\n  training\" emphasizes memory.  Concretely, what many students think\r\n  they want is for you to show in class how to solve many example problems,\r\n  for them to practice that repeatedly on related problems\r\n  (provided by homework and practice exams), and then for the exam\r\n  to include only the kinds of problems they trained for.\r\n  But such students are ill-prepared for the real world, which\r\n  will not ask the same questions they practiced in class.\r\n\r\n  One important function of ORCT is to force them out of this model,\r\n  by making it impossible to \"remember the answer\".\r\n  Some students' first reaction may be\r\n  \"why are you asking us questions you haven't already shown us how\r\n  to answer?\"  This is a *good* sign.\r\n\r\n  In the language of probability: *ORCTs should be conditionally\r\n  independent of the training given the concept*, otherwise they\r\n  are testing *memory of the training*, rather than *thinking about\r\n  the concept*.\r\n* **neutral language and context**: there should be nothing about\r\n  the wording of a question or its context that hints at the answer.\r\n  Unfortunately, even the slightest bias in wording (for example,\r\n  if you ask the students to choose between two options, but give\r\n  more text or specificity to one of them) will leak your desired\r\n  answer to the students.  This failure is almost inevitable\r\n  in a \"first draft\" ORCT text, and can only\r\n  be eliminated by very deliberate, explicit checking of the \"final\"\r\n  text, after all other considerations have been satisfied.\r\n\r\n  Note that deliberately reversing the leakage (biasing towards a wrong\r\n  answer) is also bad, both for the same reason (it obscures your view\r\n  of how the students actually think about the concept), and the\r\n  additional reason that it violates their trust.  No trick questions.\r\n\r\n  Furthermore, even if the question text is itself \"perfect\",\r\n  the overall pattern of questions you ask (\"context\") may also\r\n  give away your desired answer.  For example, say you ask many\r\n  questions that each offer a seemingly reasonable conclusion (\"the\r\n  bait\"), which always turns out to be wrong.

      "text_html": "<p>Concretely, we want to pose a question and get detailed responses from students that reveal their thinking, whatever it may be. We'll refer to this as Open Response Concept Testing (ORCT), to emphasize that it accepts any text answer (not limited to multiple choice!). The challenge of accurately identifying specific misconceptions suggests the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>focus</strong>: an ORCT should exercise a <em>single</em> concept. The purpose of an ORCT is to <em>teach</em> a concept, not to test the ability to <em>combine</em> multiple concepts (synthesis). An ORCT that involves multiple concepts will be opaque to students who don't yet correctly understand one of the concepts, yielding no useful learning or information. Focusing on a single concept maximizes the chance that students will be able to articulate an answer that reveals how they think about that concept.</li>\n<li><strong>real-world application</strong>: the easiest and most useful model for writing an ORCT is to take <em>any real-world problem that involves the concept</em>, and to ask a question that's simple enough to fit our other criteria (e.g. <em>focus</em> only on that concept). Drawing on real world problems that you want students to be able to solve after they complete the course, both signals students what really matters, and creates powerful motivation (because they see that the concepts are key for figuring out real problems).</li>\n<li><p><strong>hide in plain sight</strong>: the question should be easy for anyone who understands the concept, but <em>requires</em> understanding (guessing won't work). Aim for 1/3 to 2/3 of your students to get it &quot;mostly right&quot;.</p>\n<p>&quot;hide&quot; means the answer requires <em>thinking</em> about the concept, not just remembering something you told them; &quot;in plain sight&quot; means the answer lies directly in view of such thought (not hidden under a rock!).</p></li>\n<li><strong>speed</strong>: once the student understands what the question is asking, it should only take a minute or two to think out their answer, and another couple minutes to type and submit their answer. ORCT are for <em>teaching</em>, hence each ORCT should perform its function as quickly as possible, so that students can learn as many concepts <em>as possible</em> per unit time. In other words, the limit on how much they can learn per unit time should not be <em>how long the ORCT takes to answer</em> but rather <em>how long the students' follow-up work takes</em> (to fix their misconceptions exposed by the ORCT).</li>\n<li><strong>simplicity</strong>: to achieve the above goals, we generally have to dramatically simplify a real-world problem, down to an extremely simple core question.</li>\n<li><strong>conceptual thinking, not mechanics, and not remembering</strong>: the solution should depend only on thinking about the concept, not on mechanical operations (e.g. solving an algebra equation). The purpose of ORCT is to reveal how each student thinks about the concept; nothing extraneous should be allowed to get in the way of that. Note also that we need the students to voice <em>their own thoughts</em>, in their own words, otherwise we can't learn how they actually think. In particular, we should avoid triggering their instinct to echo back our original definition of the concept -- all that would show is that they <em>remember what we said</em>, not that they understand how to use it.</li>\n<li><p><strong>identifiability</strong>: the wording of the question should do its best to elicit a specific statement of the student's reasoning, so that we can diagnose the underlying conceptual error for any wrong answer. One simple way to do this is to ask for a definite answer to a specific question (&quot;Are Propositions 1 and 2 in fact contradictory?&quot;), and then ask them to provide their logical justification (&quot;If so, briefly explain why; if not, why not&quot;).</p>\nIndeed, one could go so far as to say this is the key purpose of ORCT: to elicit <em>interpretable wrong answers</em>. That is, for every student with a misconception about this concept, get them to articulate it clearly. (&quot;All right answers resemble one another, but each wrong answer is wrong in its own way&quot;). Note that this is <em>difficult</em>: if one out of five of the students' wrong answers is <em>lucidly</em> wrong, you are doing well!</li>\n<li><p><strong>independence</strong>: each ORCT should have as little connection as possible to &quot;what you told them&quot; in your lecture intro. The key word of course is &quot;possible&quot;: it <em>must</em> have some connection to what you told them, namely the concept itself -- but no more. In particular, it must not be possible to &quot;remember the answer&quot; to an ORCT -- otherwise it is merely testing <em>memory</em>, not thinking or understanding.</p>\n<p>This is challenging, because students (especially undergraduates) are trained to think success = &quot;knowing the right answer&quot;, via a process of training by repetition: repeat a procedure over and over until you &quot;know how to do it&quot;. This &quot;algorithm training&quot; emphasizes memory. Concretely, what many students think they want is for you to show in class how to solve many example problems, for them to practice that repeatedly on related problems (provided by homework and practice exams), and then for the exam to include only the kinds of problems they trained for. But such students are ill-prepared for the real world, which will not ask the same questions they practiced in class.</p>\n<p>One important function of ORCT is to force them out of this model, by making it impossible to &quot;remember the answer&quot;. Some students' first reaction may be &quot;why are you asking us questions you haven't already shown us how to answer?&quot; This is a <em>good</em> sign.</p>\nIn the language of probability: <em>ORCTs should be conditionally independent of the training given the concept</em>, otherwise they are testing <em>memory of the training</em>, rather than <em>thinking about the concept</em>.</li>\n<li><p><strong>neutral language and context</strong>: there should be nothing about the wording of a question or its context that hints at the answer. Unfortunately, even the slightest bias in wording (for example, if you ask the students to choose between two options, but give more text or specificity to one of them) will leak your desired answer to the students. This failure is almost inevitable in a &quot;first draft&quot; ORCT text, and can only be eliminated by very deliberate, explicit checking of the &quot;final&quot; text, after all other considerations have been satisfied.</p>\n<p>Note that deliberately reversing the leakage (biasing towards a wrong answer) is also bad, both for the same reason (it obscures your view of how the students actually think about the concept), and the additional reason that it violates their trust. No trick questions.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if the question text is itself &quot;perfect&quot;, the overall pattern of questions you ask (&quot;context&quot;) may also give away your desired answer. For example, say you ask many questions that each offer a seemingly reasonable conclusion (&quot;the bait&quot;), which always turns out to be wrong. This will train students to always <em>reject the bait</em> even if they don't really understand the concept. Such <em>language or context leakage</em> defeats the purpose of concept testing. Randomly vary your &quot;pattern&quot; in each ORCT you write (i.e. 50% of &quot;seemingly reasonable conclusions&quot; should turn out to be right).</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, there are <em>many competing behaviors</em> students can fall into besides &quot;showing how I think about this concept&quot;. ORCT design must systematically de-select those behaviors and channel students into lucidly showing you how they think.</p>\n<p>It should be emphasized that ORCT is a purposefully <em>artificial</em> construct, in that it differs from typical real-world problems in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>typically, real-world problems involve <em>multiple</em> concepts, which must be selected and combined to solve the problem.</li>\n<li>typically, they require <em>mechanical operations</em>, e.g. solving algebra equations or performing substantial computations.</li>\n<li>they take a lot longer to solve than an ORCT.</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "text": "A concept inventory is a criterion-referenced test designed to evaluate whether a student has an accurate working knowledge of a specific set of concepts. To ensure interpretability, it is common to have multiple items that address a single idea. Typically, concept inventories are organized as multiple-choice tests in order to ensure that they are scored in a reproducible manner, a feature that also facilitates administration in large classes. Unlike a typical, teacher-authored multiple-choice test, questions and response choices on concept inventories are the subject of extensive research. The aims of the research include ascertaining (a) the range of what individuals think a particular question is asking and (b) the most common responses to the questions. Concept inventories are evaluated to ensure test reliability and validity. In its final form, each question includes one correct answer and several distractors. The distractors are incorrect answers that are usually (but not always) based on students' commonly held misconceptions.\nIdeally, a score on a criterion-referenced test reflects the amount of content knowledge a student has mastered. Criterion-referenced tests differ from norm-referenced tests in that (in theory) the former is not used to compare an individual's score to the scores of the group. Ordinarily, the purpose of a criterion-referenced test is to ascertain whether a student mastered a predetermined amount of content knowledge; upon obtaining a test score that is at or above a cutoff score, the student can move on to study a body of content knowledge that follows next in a learning sequence. In general, item difficulty values ranging between 30% and 70% are best able to provide information about student understanding.\nDistractors are often based on ideas commonly held by students, as determined by years of research on misconceptions. Test developers often research student misconceptions by examining students' responses to open-ended essay questions and conducting \"think-aloud\" interviews with students. The distractors chosen by students help researchers understand student thinking and give instructors insights into students' prior knowledge (and, sometimes, firmly held beliefs). This foundation in research underlies instrument construction and design, and plays a role in helping educators obtain clues about students' ideas, scientific misconceptions, and didaskalogenic, that is, teacher-induced confusions and conceptual lacunae that interfere with learning.",

      "text": "A photon is an elementary particle, the quantum of light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force, even when static via virtual photons. The effects of this force are easily observable at both the microscopic and macroscopic level, because the photon has zero rest mass; this allows long distance interactions. Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by quantum mechanics and exhibit wave\u2013particle duality, exhibiting properties of both waves and particles. For example, a single photon may be refracted by a lens or exhibit wave interference with itself, but also act as a particle giving a definite result when its position is measured.\nThe modern photon concept was developed gradually by Albert Einstein to explain experimental observations that did not fit the classical wave model of light. In particular, the photon model accounted for the frequency dependence of light's energy, and explained the ability of matter and radiation to be in thermal equilibrium. It also accounted for anomalous observations, including the properties of black-body radiation, that other physicists, most notably Max Planck, had sought to explain using semiclassical models, in which light is still described by Maxwell's equations, but the material objects that emit and absorb light do so in amounts of energy that are quantized (i.e., they change energy only by certain particular discrete amounts and cannot change energy in any arbitrary way). Although these semiclassical models contributed to the development of quantum mechanics, many further experiments starting with Compton scattering of single photons by electrons, first observed in 1923, validated Einstein's hypothesis that light itself is quantized. In 1926 the optical physicist Frithiof Wolfers and the chemist Gilbert N. Lewis coined the name photon for these particles, and after 1927, when Arthur H.

      "text": "Summation is the operation of adding a sequence of numbers; the result is their sum or total. If numbers are added sequentially from left to right, any intermediate result is a partial sum, prefix sum, or running total of the summation. The numbers to be summed (called addends, or sometimes summands) may be integers, rational numbers, real numbers, or complex numbers. Besides numbers, other types of values can be added as well: vectors, matrices, polynomials and, in general, elements of any additive group (or even monoid). For finite sequences of such elements, summation always produces a well-defined sum (possibly by virtue of the convention for empty sums).\nThe summation of an infinite sequence of values is called a series. A value of such a series may often be defined, by means of a limit (although sometimes the value may be infinite, and often no value results at all). Another notion involving limits of finite sums is integration. The term summation has a special meaning related to extrapolation in the context of divergent series.\nThe summation of the sequence [1, 2, 4, 2] is an expression whose value is the sum of each of the members of the sequence. In the example, 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 9. Since addition is associative the value does not depend on how the additions are grouped, for instance (1 + 2) + (4 + 2) and 1 + ((2 + 4) + 2) both have the value 9; therefore, parentheses are usually omitted in repeated additions. Addition is also commutative, so permuting the terms of a finite sequence does not change its sum (for infinite summations this property may fail; see absolute convergence for conditions under which it still holds).\nThere is no special notation for the summation of such explicit sequences, as the corresponding repeated addition expression will do. There is only a slight difficulty if the sequence has fewer than two elements: the summation of a sequence of one term involves no plus sign (it is indistinguishable from the term itself) and the summation of the empty sequence cannot even be written down (but one can write its value \"0\" in its place). If, however, the terms of the sequence are given by a regular pattern, possibly of variable length, then a summation operator may be useful or even essential. For the summation of the sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to 100 one could use an addition expression involving an ellipsis to indicate the missing terms: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 99 + 100. In this case the reader easily guesses the pattern; however, for more complicated patterns, one needs to be precise about the rule used to find successive terms, which can be achieved by using the summation operator \"\u03a3\". Using this sigma notation the above summation is written as:\n\nThe value of this summation is 5050. It can be found without performing 99 additions, since it can be shown (for instance by mathematical induction) that\n\nfor all natural numbers n (see Triangular number). More generally, formulae exist for many summations of terms following a regular pattern.\nThe term \"indefinite summation\" refers to the search for an inverse image of a given infinite sequence s of values for the forward difference operator, in other words for a sequence, called antidifference of s, whose finite differences are given by s. By contrast, summation as discussed in this article is called \"definite summation\".\nWhen it is necessary to clarify that numbers are added with their signs, the term algebraic sum is used. For example, in electric circuit theory Kirchhoff's circuit laws consider the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point, assigning opposite signs to currents flowing in and out of the node.",

Since addition is associative the value does not depend on how the additions are grouped, for instance (1 + 2) + (4 + 2) and 1 + ((2 + 4) + 2) both have the value 9; therefore, parentheses are usually omitted in repeated additions. Addition is also commutative, so permuting the terms of a finite sequence does not change its sum (for infinite summations this property may fail; see absolute convergence for conditions under which it still holds). There is no special notation for the summation of such explicit sequences, as the corresponding repeated addition expression will do. There is only a slight difficulty if the sequence has fewer than two elements: the summation of a sequence of one term involves no plus sign (it is indistinguishable from the term itself) and the summation of the empty sequence cannot even be written down (but one can write its value &quot;0&quot; in its place). If, however, the terms of the sequence are given by a regular pattern, possibly of variable length, then a summation operator may be useful or even essential. For the summation of the sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to 100 one could use an addition expression involving an ellipsis to indicate the missing terms: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 99 + 100. In this case the reader easily guesses the pattern; however, for more complicated patterns, one needs to be precise about the rule used to find successive terms, which can be achieved by using the summation operator &quot;\u03a3&quot;. Using this sigma notation the above summation is written as:</p>\n<p>The value of this summation is 5050. It can be found without performing 99 additions, since it can be shown (for instance by mathematical induction) that</p>\n<p>for all natural numbers n (see Triangular number). More generally, formulae exist for many summations of terms following a regular pattern. The term &quot;indefinite summation&quot; refers to the search for an inverse image of a given infinite sequence s of values for the forward difference operator, in other words for a sequence, called antidifference of s, whose finite differences are given by s. By contrast, summation as discussed in this article is called &quot;definite summation&quot;. When it is necessary to clarify that numbers are added with their signs, the term algebraic sum is used. For example, in electric circuit theory Kirchhoff's circuit laws consider the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point, assigning opposite signs to currents flowing in and out of the node.</p>\n",

In particular, students who have learned other skills well, may have poor conceptual understanding.\r\n* unless a question is designed very carefully to measure conceptual understanding and *not* other skills such as synthesis, procedures or memory, its scores will correlate poorly with conceptual understanding.\r\n* conceptual understanding is different from other skills, in that it consists largely of *hidden knowledge* -- the ability to think through and obey a concept's many implications.  This is both its power -- it applies to any new situation -- and its challenge.\r\n* Even for experts, these implications are often unconscious.
